# 🎾 Tennis Tournament Application 🚀
This is the unofficial application for signing up to tennis tournaments in Germany.

> [!WARNING]
> The application currently is under active development!

## 💡 Motivation 💡
🔍 The current platforms for searching tournaments lack efficiency and have poor usability.  
❌ They lack key features like notifications, advanced filtering, and a better UI.  
💡 This inspired me to build my own tournament platform with better functionality.  
🛠️ To achieve this, I first need reliable tournament data, so I am developing this API as the backbone for future projects.
